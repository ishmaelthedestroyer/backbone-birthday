Backbone Birthday
===========

This application was created to showcase some of Backbone's core features including models, collections, views, and routing.
<br /><br />

## Notes
A month model is created that holds two attributes, a month's title and it's numerical placement (i.e. January = 1, Feb = 2, etc). <br />
A year collection is instantiated with an array of Month objects. <br />
